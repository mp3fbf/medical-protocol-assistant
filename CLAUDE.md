## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** with App Router and TypeScript
- **tRPC** for type-safe API endpoints
- **Prisma** ORM with PostgreSQL database
- **NextAuth** for authentication with RBAC (CREATOR/REVIEWER/ADMIN)
- **React Query** for server state management
- **ReactFlow** for protocol flowchart visualization
- **Multi-Provider AI** integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) with abstraction layer

### Core Concepts

- **Medical Protocols**: 13-section structured documents with metadata, indications, procedures, and flowcharts
- **Protocol Versions**: Immutable versions with audit logging for all changes
- **Role-Based Access**: Users have creator, reviewer, or admin permissions
- **AI Generation**: Multiple generation modes with provider abstraction
  - **Automatic**: AI research + full protocol generation
  - **Manual**: Section-by-section with AI assistance
  - **Material-Based**: Upload documents (PDF/DOCX/TXT) + optional research supplementation
- **Document Upload**: Parse medical materials (PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown) to generate protocols
- **Advanced Validation**: Comprehensive medical content validation system ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
  - **Medical Safety**: Dosage validation, procedure safety checks, contraindication warnings
  - **Completeness**: Required fields validation, section completeness
  - **Evidence-Based**: Bibliography and reference quality validation
  - **Manual Validation**: Click-to-validate with detailed error reporting and categorization
  - **Professional UI**: Error count badges, scrollable issue list, and improvement suggestions
- **Smart Flowchart Generation**: AI-powered flowchart creation with medical intelligence
  - **Protocol Type Detection**: Automatic classification (Emergency, Diagnostic, Therapeutic, Monitoring)
  - **Intelligent Layouts**: Type-specific node arrangements and priorities
  - **Medical Optimization**: Focus on critical decision points and safety protocols
- **Document Export**: Generate DOCX/PDF with ABNT medical formatting standards

  - `protocol-schema.ts` - Zod schemas for data validation
  - `medical-content.ts` - Medical-specific validation rules
  - `completeness.ts` - Protocol completeness validation
  - `cross-validation.ts` - Cross-section consistency checks
- `/src/lib/flowchart/` - Smart flowchart generation system
  - `smart-generator.ts` - AI-powered flowchart generation with medical intelligence

  - `layout.ts` - Layout algorithms for different protocol types
- `/src/server/api/routers/` - tRPC API endpoints
- `/tests/e2e/` - Playwright tests with authentication setup

### Development Guidelines

- All protocol changes must be audited and logged
- Every protocol requires all 13 medical sections
- UI text in Portuguese, code comments in English
- No `any` types - strict TypeScript enforcement
- Functional components only, no class components
- Tailwind CSS for all styling (no custom CSS)
- Pre-commit hooks run Prettier and ESLint automatically
- Always update @README.md and @docs/project-roadmap.md and run pnpm build before each commit

### Common Errors and Solutions

**ThemeProvider Error (FREQUENT ISSUE)**:

- **Error**: `useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider`
- **Cause**: ThemeToggle component used outside ThemeProvider context (usually in login page)
- **SOLUTION**: DO NOT use ThemeToggle in the login page or any page outside the (auth) group
- **Why**: Login page renders before GlobalProviders are ready, causing context error
- **Note**: ThemeProvider is in GlobalProviders but login page has special rendering

### Database Schema

- `User` - Authentication with hashed passwords and roles
- `Protocol` - Main protocol entities with metadata
- `ProtocolVersion` - Immutable versions of protocol content
- `AuditLog` - Track all protocol creation and modification events

### Performance Requirements

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANTE: QUALIDADE SOBRE VELOCIDADE ‚ö†Ô∏è**

- **PRIORIDADE ABSOLUTA**: Qualidade e completude do conte√∫do m√©dico
- **SEM ECONOMIA**: N√£o economizar tokens ou tempo se comprometer qualidade
- **COMPLEXIDADE ESPERADA**: Protocolos s√£o obrigatoriamente complexos e extensos
- **NUNCA IMPLEMENTAR ATALHOS** que reduzam qualidade para ganhar performance

Tempos aceit√°veis (mas N√ÉO s√£o limitantes):

- AI protocol generation: 5-15 minutos (O3 pode levar o tempo necess√°rio)
- Document export: <30 seconds
- Page load times: <3 seconds for authenticated routes
- Protocol validation: <30 seconds para an√°lise completa

### UI/UX Design System

**Ultra Design System v2** - A modern, mathematical design system:

- **Mathematical Spacing**: Based on Golden Ratio (1.618) for harmonious proportions
- **Glassmorphism Effects**: Modern glass-like UI elements with backdrop blur
- **Gradient System**: Vibrant gradients (indigo ‚Üí purple ‚Üí pink) for CTAs
- **Typography**: Fluid responsive sizing with excellent readability
- **Animations**: Smooth Spring physics-based transitions
- **Information Density**: Maximized screen real estate usage
- **Accessibility**: Full support for `prefers-reduced-motion` and high contrast
