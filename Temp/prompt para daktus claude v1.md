You are tasked with analyzing the provided protocol examples and transforming the deep research content into this protocol format. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, detailed, and logical representation of the research in the protocol format.
First, carefully examine the protocol examples in the PDF files I've attached to this message. Analyze the structure, components, and flow of these examples, paying attention to:
1. The overall layout and organization
2. Types of elements used (e.g., decision points, process steps, inputs/outputs)
3. Connections and relationships between elements
4. Any specific symbols or notations used
5. The level of detail in each step or component
Now, review the deep research content in the Markdown file I've attached. This contains all the information that needs to be transformed into the protocol format.
To transform the deep research into the protocol format:
1. Identify the main topics, processes, or workflows in the research.
2. Break down each topic into discrete steps or decision points.
3. Organize these steps in a logical sequence, mirroring the structure observed in the protocol examples.
4. For each step:
   a. Determine if it's a process, decision, input, or output.
   b. Write a clear, concise description.
   c. Identify any conditions or criteria for decision points.
   d. Note any inputs required or outputs produced.
5. Establish connections between steps, showing the flow of information or processes.
6. Include any relevant data, metrics, or key performance indicators (KPIs) from the research.
7. Add any necessary annotations, explanations, or additional details to ensure clarity.
Create your protocol representation using the following guidelines:
1. Use appropriate symbols for different types of steps (e.g., rectangles for processes, diamonds for decisions).
2. Label each step clearly and concisely.
3. Use arrows to show the flow between steps.
4. Group related steps or processes together.
5. Include a legend if you use any unique symbols or color coding.
6. Ensure the overall layout is clear, logical, and easy to follow.
Once you have created the protocol representation, review it to ensure:
1. All key information from the deep research is included.
2. The flow is logical and follows the structure of the protocol examples.
3. It is comprehensive, detailed, and clear.
4. Any potential gaps or areas needing clarification are identified and addressed.
Your final output should be a textual description of the protocol, structured in a way that could be easily translated into a visual flowchart/algorithm format. Use appropriate XML tags to structure your output, such as <step>, <decision>, <process>, <input>, <output>, and <connection> tags.
Begin your response with:
<protocol_representation>
End your response with:
</protocol_representation>
Remember, your final output should only include the textual description of the protocol representation, structured with appropriate XML tags. Do not include any of your thought process or analysis in the final output.
