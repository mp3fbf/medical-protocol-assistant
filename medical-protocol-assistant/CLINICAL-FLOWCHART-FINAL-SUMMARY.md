# Clinical Flowchart Generation - Final Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The clinical flowchart generation system has been successfully implemented and is now the default format for flowchart generation in the application.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **New Clinical Format System**

- Created comprehensive prompts for generating rich clinical flowcharts (`/src/lib/ai/prompts/flowchart-clinical.ts`)
- Implemented clinical generator with full Zod validation (`/src/lib/flowchart/clinical-generator.ts`)
- Added support for questionnaires, detailed medical conducts, and HTML formatting
- Integrated with the modular generation system

### 2. **UI Updates**

- Changed default flowchart generation to clinical format
- Updated button text to "Gerar Fluxograma Clínico"
- Both initial generation and regeneration now use clinical format

### 3. **Backend Integration**

- Router now recognizes `format: "clinical"` and routes to clinical generator
- Clinical generator uses O3 model for best results
- Full support for progress tracking during generation

## How It Works

### Clinical Format Features

1. **Questionnaire Nodes (type: "custom")**

   - Multiple questions with various input types (radio, checkbox, text)
   - Conditional visibility based on previous answers
   - Rich HTML descriptions
   - Medical concept UIDs (e.g., "DOR_TORACICA", "DISPNEIA")

2. **Medical Conduct Nodes (type: "conduct")**

   - Detailed medication information with HTML-formatted posologia
   - Exam orders with codes and CID
   - Patient orientations
   - Referrals to specialists
   - Alert messages for critical information

3. **Summary/Triage Nodes (type: "summary")**
   - Detailed HTML-formatted descriptions
   - Tags for categorization
   - Used for triage systems like Manchester

### Example Clinical Node Structure

```json
{
  "id": "conduct-1",
  "type": "conduct",
  "data": {
    "type": "conduct",
    "label": "Conduta Inicial para Dor Torácica",
    "condicional": "visivel",
    "condicao": "DOR_TORACICA == 'sim_tipica'",
    "condutaDataNode": {
      "medicamento": [
        {
          "id": "med1",
          "nomeMed": "AAS",
          "posologia": "<p><strong>Dose:</strong> 300mg VO<br/><strong>Frequência:</strong> Dose única<br/><strong>Observação:</strong> Mastigar o comprimido</p>",
          "viaAplicacao": "Oral"
        }
      ],
      "exame": [
        {
          "id": "ex1",
          "nome": "ECG 12 derivações",
          "codigo": "40.01.01.10-8",
          "indicacao": "Realizar em menos de 10 minutos"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Using the System

### For End Users

1. Navigate to any protocol
2. Click on "Ver Fluxograma" or go to the flowchart page
3. Click "Gerar Fluxograma Clínico" button
4. The system will generate a rich flowchart with:
   - Interactive questionnaires for patient assessment
   - Detailed medical conducts with medications and procedures
   - Conditional branching based on patient responses
   - HTML-formatted content for better readability

### For Developers

To generate a clinical flowchart programmatically:

```typescript
import { generateClinicalFlowchart } from "@/lib/flowchart/clinical-generator";

const result = await generateClinicalFlowchart(
  "Protocol Condition Name",
  protocolContent,
  {
    model: "o3",
    temperature: 0.3,
    progressCallback: (message) => console.log(message),
  },
);
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Rich Medical Content**: Full support for medications, exams, orientations, and referrals
2. **Interactive Assessment**: Questionnaires with conditional logic
3. **Professional Formatting**: HTML support for better readability
4. **Medical Intelligence**: AI understands and creates proper medical workflows
5. **No Conversion Needed**: Direct generation in clinical format

## Troubleshooting

### If you encounter validation errors:

- The Zod schema now accepts both `title` and `label` fields for start/end nodes
- All fields have sensible defaults if not provided by AI

### If the flowchart doesn't generate:

1. Ensure the protocol has content in relevant sections (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
2. Check browser console for any errors
3. The O3 model is required for best results

## Next Steps

The clinical flowchart generation is now fully operational. Users can:

- Generate rich, interactive flowcharts directly from protocol content
- Export flowcharts in JSON format (clinical format)
- Edit and customize the generated flowcharts manually
- View detailed medical information in a professional format

The system is ready for production use and provides a significant improvement over the simplified flowchart format.
