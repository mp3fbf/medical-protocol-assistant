  # The Vercel deployment will now be handled by Vercel's native Git integration.
  # This GitHub Actions workflow primarily serves as a CI check.
  # No Vercel CLI deployment steps are needed here anymore.
  # Vercel will see the push to 'main' or 'develop' (if configured in Vercel project settings)
  # and trigger its own build and deployment process using the `vercel.json` and
  # environment variables set in the Vercel dashboard.
